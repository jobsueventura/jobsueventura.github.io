    <h1>Amelio Robles's Gender Battles In The Zapatista army</h1>
    <p>Gabriela Cano’s article "Amelio Robles’s Gender Battles in the Zapatista Army" tells the remarkable story of Amelio Robles, a revolutionary fighter who defied the rigid expectations of gender during the Mexican Revolution. Born Amelia Robles in rural Guerrero, he found in war not just a cause, but the freedom to embrace the masculine identity that truly reflected who he was. Unlike others who disguised themselves as men for survival, Amelio fully stepped into his identity, earning the respect of his fellow soldiers and even official recognition as a male veteran. His story is one of resilience, courage, and self-determination—yet history has not always honored it truthfully. Cano’s work explores how his identity both challenged and fit within the era’s gender norms and how, over time, historical narratives sought to erase or redefine the life he fought so hard to live.</p>
