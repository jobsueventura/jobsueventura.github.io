<h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>We have seen how Zapatismo became one of the epic revolution’s most popular re- gional agrarian movements. Moreover, the personal accounts of Pedro and Esper- anza Martínez afforded an intimate glimpse of the horrific impact that the revolution visited upon the men and women of Zapatismo whose families were dislocated by “la bola.” Over the past two decades historians have rewritten the history of the Mexican revolution from the perspective of women and gender relationships, asking to what extent the great upheaval was truly a revolution for women and whether deep-seated patriarchal relations were transformed during the fighting and under the new revolutionary state that consolidated in its wake. Gabriela Cano, one of the most distinguished historians of revolutionary and postrevolutionary Mexico, has made foundational contributions to these discussions. In the selection below, which focuses on the life and military career of Zapatista colonel Amelio Robles, she expands the boundaries of the revolution’s historiography of gender and sexuality, examining the unusual transgendering of Amelia Robles, a small-town rural woman from the south- ern state of Guerrero.</p>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Mexican Revolution (1910–1920) was a period of immense social and political upheaval that also disrupted traditional gender roles, creating opportunities for individuals to challenge rigid societal norms. Among these figures was Amelio Robles, a revolutionary who defied expectations by living as a man and gaining recognition within military and social spheres. Historians have increasingly revisited the revolution through the lens of gender, highlighting cases like Robles’s to explore how war and social change allowed for more fluid expressions of identity, reshaping historical narratives on gender and masculinity.2</p>
